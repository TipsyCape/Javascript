This is for the Sol Lewitt project

First, created a black background and changed the line colors to white.
Second, I used a nested for loop to generate a bunch of random lines originating in the center of the screen. This effect reminded me of the warp drive from star wars, so i based the rest of my design off that theme
Third, i used a normal for loop to draw a bunch of random dots on the screen, to resemble stars
Fourth, I added some triangles to get some color in there. 
Fifth and finally, I added the lines into each of the triangles to give an appealing design
